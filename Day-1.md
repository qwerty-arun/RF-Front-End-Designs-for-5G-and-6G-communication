# Day-1 Key Learnings
- Why to automate the process of fabricating the antenna?
- Microstrip patch antenna in cylindrical configuration, spherical configuration, superstrates
- Conformal arrays
- What is FSS?
- Holographic antennas
- Lenses: curved lenses and flat lenses
- Periodic structures: AMC, uniform and non-uniform superstrate
- Reflectarray antenna: narrow BW, high gain, high efficiency
- Luneburg lenses
- ANTENNA GURU AI
- What are the different types of antennas on mobiles, what are the frequency bands?
- Typically the CRO, cable are made of 50ohms, why? At 30ohms, there is very good power handling capabilities and at 70ohms, it has lowest attenuation
- Concept of impedance matching, the CRO and the cable are already matched, only we need to care of the antenna.
- Vector networks analyser
- Wifi analyser of our phones
- dB, dBm and watts
- 0dBm = 1mW, 1W = 0dB = 30dBm
- Conditions for radiation: time varying fields, bent, terminated, curved configurations and non-uniform velocity of electrons
- Field regions around an antenna
- Tri-pole antenna, in a single antenna, three different frequencies can be operated with. There is no interference, that we need to take care of.
- There is 8-pole antenna too, but again isolation is difficult
